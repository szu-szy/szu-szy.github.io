# App requirements

Imagine that you're creating new website for company that will be Netflix competitor. This website needs to display the top 100 movies based on the iTunes API.

#### Base Requirements

- Show top 100 movies based on the json feed: https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/topmovies/limit=100/json

- Clean, readable, maintainable codebase

- A good user experience

- Code added to your GitHub repository

- Show us your work through your commit history!

- Use React + TS

#### Optional

- Make use of animations

- Allow the top 100 to be searchable

- Allow the user to see more information about a selected Movie

- Host the site on the service of your choice (AWS, Azure, github.io address, etc)

### Bonus Round

- Surprise us! Add a feature that you think would work well here (for instance, advanced search, integration with other API, a "Favorite" functionality)
